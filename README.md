Mutli-Year Stock Data


-For this project, I was asked to use VBA scripting to analyze stock market data from a series of years. To achieve this I was able to loop through each spreadsheet to calculate yearly change of stocks open/close prices, the stocks yearly percent changes, and the stocks total volume. Additionly, I calculated which stocks had the greatest percent increase, percent decrease, and the greatest total volume.
